                Dear [Her Name],<br><br>
                On this special day, I want to take a moment to remind you just how much you mean to me. Even though we are miles apart, my heart is with you, celebrating every moment of your birthday. You are the light of my life, and I feel so lucky to have you by my side. Every day with you feels like a dream come true, and I can't wait to create more beautiful memories together.<br><br>
                I wish I could be there with you today, but know that my thoughts and love are with you, wrapping you in warmth and happiness. May your day be filled with joy, laughter, and everything you wish for.<br><br>
                Happy Birthday, my love. Here's to many more birthdays spent together, side by side.<br><br>
                With all my love,<br>
                [Your Name]
