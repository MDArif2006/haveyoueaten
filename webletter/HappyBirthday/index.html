            On this special day, I want you to know how much you mean to me. Even though we're miles apart, my love for you grows stronger day by day. I hope this day is filled with love, joy, and everything your heart desires.<br><br>
            Happy 23rd birthday. Being away from you is never easy, especially on days like today when all I want to do is hold you close and celebrate the incredible person you are. Distance may keep us apart physically, but it can never destroy the deep connection with 2 hearts. You are always in my thoughts, and my heart beats a little faster just thinking about you.<br><br>
            baby! It feels like just yesterday we meet but it's already almost 5 months. I'm so so happy with you. Really so happy. Suddenly we fall in love. But now I'm regretting by make you fall in love without show me first. It's really look selfish. You already give me many pictures of your even though I never asked. But you asked me several times for my picture. But I didn't give you. But I don't wanna be selfish anymore. I'm gonna give my picture. But wait.. I have to tell it first.. I'm uglier than the photo because the picture, has used little filter ðŸ˜…<br><br>
            Anyway, as usual, I'll say again, I'm ugly. If you don't like me, then don't worry. You can leave me anytime when you want. I'll never force you to stay if you don't like me. If you wanna leave me then don't tell me directly because it'll be more hurt. So, just make an excuse first like..<br>"I'm busy for work, I gotta go to university, I'm tired, I'm gonna outside with friends that's why I can't call or text you...." Something like this. And don't text or call me for few days. And It'll be easy for you to leave me even though it'll be hurt for me but don't worry about me. Because I think I shouldn't force someone who doesn't like me or doesn't want me. At last I wanna tell, I don't know who'll be my wife and who'll be your husband in the future, but I'll love you forever ðŸ’•

            Anyway, as you turn 23, I wish for you a year filled with endless joy, success, and love. And I hope you'll get a person who you really like and love.. and also hope I can be that last person until alive ðŸ¥° yaa.. I still hope it even though I know I'm ugly.. what a stupid I am ðŸ˜…<br>That's ok.. <br>At last, I wanna say, May you continue to shine brightly, achieving all your dreams and more. You have a spirit that inspires me every day, and I am so proud and happy of the person you are and all that you have accomplished.
